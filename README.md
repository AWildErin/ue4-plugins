# ue4-plugins
A collection of plugins I've made for UE4

### Content Importer
Content Importer is a custom plugin I wrote to import RMesh files from SCP:CB. It imports them with the correct material paths and works at the correct scale for UE4.


### Nif Importer
This plugin imports model files from the Fallout games.

It requires [nifly](https://github.com/ousnius/nifly) in order to compile
